This project implements a Spam or Ham classifier using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. The model is trained to efficiently distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. It's a straightforward approach but delivers robust results, making it ideal for applications like email filtering or SMS categorization.
